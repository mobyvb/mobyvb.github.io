<p>This site is <em>very</em> under construction right now, but I figured if I don&rsquo;t update my site, I&rsquo;ll never get around to it.</p>
<p>This site is using a custom Hugo theme I made, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/mobyvb/lattice-hugo-theme">here</a>, along with instructions for how to use it. There is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Maximillian Mohammed von Briesen, or Moby for short. I live just outside of Atlanta, GA. I studied Computer Science and Music Technology at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, and I currently work as a software developer at <a href="https://storj.io/">Storj Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Software development is something I got into at a very early age, and it turned out to be a fortunate hobby to pick up. My career as a developer kicked off in high school, carried on throughout college, and continues to this day. I have previously worked at <a href="https://skookum.com/">Skookum</a>, <a href="https://bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a>, and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>Most of my position in this world is due to my parents, mentors, and a small handful of people who saw reason to extend incredible opportunities to me. I am indebted to all of these people, and hope that I will have the blessing of playing a similar role in the lives of others.</p>
<p>While much of my life to this point has been shaped by software and technology, software development is a fairly small component of my interests. Despite what the leaders of the tech industry might say, I believe that software will only play a marginal role in solving humanity&rsquo;s greatest problems. We live in a very different world now than the world of 100 or 1,000 years ago, but the patterns of greed, injustice, and the rise and fall of empires transcend those temporal boundaries.</p>
<p>I am not sure what my future looks like, but I am very passionate about sustainable living. Alternatives to centralized electricity, sewage, water supply, and communications are of particular interest to me. But ultimately, this is not really a question of creating new technology - the technology is already there for the most part. It is a question of cultivating geographically-defined social and family networks with the goal of sustainability.</p>
<p>Sustainability is not a band-aid that can be used to repair the systemic wounds in our world. It will require a complete reshaping of life as we know it, and a shift in the narrative around our future. What would a world look like without centralized water, electricity, sewage, communications, or government? It&rsquo;s an uncomfortable question, but an important one. The United States as we know it has only been around for a couple hundred years. But it has also been around as long as anyone can remember - us, our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents. The Ottoman Empire existed for over 600 years. The Roman Empire for more than 1,000. One way another, whether we would like to see it or not, whether it happens now or an a few centuries, we need to be thinking about what happens when everything changes.</p>
