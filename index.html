									<h2>I like building things</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I absolutely love web development. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I worked as a developer for Skookum Digital Works, a company headquartered in Charlotte, NC. In my first year at Georgia Tech, I worked as a web-development intern at Bitpay. Creating functional applications from nothing but text is fascinating to me, so that's what I do.</p>
								<p>But I also like making games and robots. Making cool things instead of doing homework or studying for finals is a favorite pasttime of mine. Check out the blog to see some of the projects I've worked on.</p>
								<p>Some languages and libraries I have experience with are Javascript (both frontend JS and Node), MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Python, Polymer, React, Java, and C#. Keep in mind that this list is incomplete and is constantly changing as I continue to learn.</p>
